(frosch et al., 2000; elkader et al., 2009; epstein et al., 2010). tramadol, a centrally acting synthetic opioid, that possesses antinociceptive and analgesic eﬀects (raﬀa, 2008) has emerged rapidly as a drug of abuse in the past few years (shalaby et al., 2015). it has been postulated that the pharmacological eﬀects of tramadol may be mediated by both opioid (μ-receptor agonist) and non-opioid (norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition) mechanisms (raﬀa et al., 1992; liu et al., 1999; nossaman et al., 2010), with the involvement of both in development of drug addiction (zhuo et al., 2012). noteworthy, tramadol metabolite, o-desmethyl tramadol (m1), is also. abbreviations: ache, acetylcholinesterase;

liu et al., 1999); however, these practices have augmented the number of deaths in recent years (sheikholeslami et al., 2016). tobacco consumption is one of the main public health problems worldwide and represents a leading cause of preventable deaths in most developed countries (dwoskin et al., 2009; berrendero et al., 2010). nicotine, the reinforcing addictive component of tobacco, is the major arbitrator that maintains the smoking habit (shoaib, 2006). like other addictive drugs, nicotine displays the two important characteristics to establishing and maintaining addiction; ﬁrst, by eliciting pleasant or rewarding eﬀects in the brain which reinforce self-administration behavior; and secondly, appearance of withdrawal syndrome following chronic exposure to nicotine which favors continued intake (lewis et al., 2007). neurochemical studies revealed that nicotine and opioids modulate each other eﬀect (skurtveit et al., 2010) and nicotine induced da release via activation of μ opioid receptors (tanda and di chiara, 1998). moreover, experimental studies highlighted the existence for a mechanistic overlap between opiates and nicotine within dopamine (da) reward pathway (britt and mcgehee, 2008; berrendero et al., 2010). in light of these considerations, the aim of this work was to investigate the possible modulatory eﬀects of nicotine on tramadol-induced neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes in the brain. in addition, an attempt was undertaken to clarify the possible neurochemical alterations in neurotransmitters, inﬂammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress. 2. material and methods. 2.1. animals. adult male swiss albino mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from the animal house colony of the national research center (nrc, giza, egypt). mice were allowed one week acclimatization period and were housed in groups at constant temperature (23 ± 2 °c), humidity (60 ± 10%) and a light/dark (12/12 h) cycle with lights on at 5:00 am. they were allowed free access to food and water throughout the experimental period. all behavioral experiments were carried out in separate and isolated laboratories. the study was performed in compliance with the procedures and policies approved by the research ethics committee of faculty of pharmacy, cairo university (cairo, egypt; pt 1452) in compliance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (ilar, 1996). 2.2. drugs and chemicals. tramadol hydrochloride was obtained from memphis company (cairo, egypt); nicotine solution was purchased from sigma-aldrich (mo, usa). all other chemicals and reagents used for biochemical estimations were of analytical grade. 2.3. drug treatment schedule. mice were divided in to 4 groups and treated as follows: (i) group i served as control and received the vehicle; (ii) animals in group ii were given tramadol (20 mg / kg, i.p); (iii) group iii received nicotine (0.25 mg/kg, i.p); and (iv) group iv was given tramadol and nicotine at the same doses mentioned earlier. all agents were dissolved in saline and administrated once daily for thirty days. all animals were subjected to behavioral experiments that were performed at the same time-period of the day (09:00 am -12:00 pm). behavioral tests were carried out. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. throughout the last week of the experiment while body weight was taken on weekly basis. following the exclusion of dead animals in each group, the experimental groups i and iii consisted of (6–8 animals) whereas groups ii and iv included (12–14 animals). thirty minutes following last tramadol injection in groups ii and iv, (4–6 mice) were euthanized and the brains were isolated for detection of tramadol in brain. twenty-four hours following the last treatment, (6–8 mice each group) were euthanized with cervical dislocation and brains were isolated. cortices were dissected over ice for neurotransmitters and biochemical analysis. part of cortical tissue was homogenized in 75% methanol (hplc grade, sigma-aldrich) and cortical monoamines were measured. derivatization of dried cortical homogenate was carried out for determination of gaba and glutamate. the rest of cortical tissue was homogenized in phosphate buﬀer saline (ph 7.4) for estimation of other mediators in cortices. samples were stored at −80 °c till analysis. 2.4. detection of tramadol in brain. thirty minutes following the last injection, mice were euthanized with cervical dislocation and brains were isolated and homogenized in tris−hcl buﬀer. extraction of tramadol from brain homogenates was performed according to the method described by tao et al. (2001). brieﬂy, methanol was used for protein precipitation and methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) was utilized for liquid-liquid extraction (lle). subsequently, the mtbe layer was evaporated under nitrogen ﬂow and the residue was reconstituted with 50 μl of methanol (hplc grade). a sample volume of 3 μl was injected in gc.ms (agilent 6890 network capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector agilent 5973 network; ca, usa) using dextromethorphan as internal standard (i.s.). 2.5. biochemical measurements. 2.5.1. determination of cortical tbars, npshs and no contents. thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) content was measured according to the method described by mihara and uchiyama (1978). in brief, thiobarbituric acid in o-phosphoric acid was added to the homogenate and boiled for 20 min, cooled and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min then the resultant complex was read at 532 nm. non protein sulfhydryls (npshs) content was measured according to the method of ellman (1959) and modiﬁed by beutler et al. (1963). after precipitation of protein, ellman’s reagent (5, 5\\-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) was reduced by sulfhydryl (sh) group to form 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoic acid that has an intense yellow color and can be determined colorimetrically at 412 nm. nitric oxide (no) was determined using griess reagent according to the method described by miranda et al. (2001), the absorbance was read at 540 nm. 2.5.2. determination of cortical tnf-α, nfκb, inos and nnos. elisa kits for tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α; csb-e04741), nuclear factor kappa b (nfκb; csb-e12108) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos; csb-e08326) were purchased from cusabio (wuhan, prc) whereas neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos; mbs753956) was obtained from mybiosource (ca, usa) and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. 2.5.3. determination of cortical monoamines and amino acids. estimation of dopamine (da), serotonin (5 h t) and norepinephrine (ne) was carried out according to the method of pagel et al. (2000) using hplc (perkin-elmer, ma, usa). brieﬂy, homogenized samples were extracted from trace elements and lipids by solid phase extraction. each sample (40 μl) was ﬁltered (0.25 μm, millipore, ma, usa) then injected into an aqua column (c18, 150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, phenomenex,ca, usa), using mobile phase (methanol: acetonitrile; 97:3 v), ﬂow rate 1.5 ml/min, and peaks were detected at 270 nm. moreover, glutamate (glu) and gamma amino butyric acid (gaba) were. 246. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. estimated according to the method of heinrikson and meredith (1984), using the hplc system (perkin-elmer). the reconstituted cortical residues (methanol: 1 m sodium acetate: triethylamine; 2:2:1 v) were redried under vacuum. using the precolumn isothiocyanate derivatization technique, samples were subjected to a 20 min derivatization performed using a methanol: triethylamine: double-distilled deionized water: phenylisothiocyanate (7:1:1:1 v), redried under vacuum, then reconstituted with sample diluents (acetonitrile: 5 mm phosphate buﬀer; 5:95 v; ph = 7.2). sonicated and ﬁltered (0.45 μm; millipore) samples were run on a pico-tag c18 (300 mm × 3.9 mm, i.d., waters, ct, usa) and a binary gradient of eluents 1 and 2 (waters) were used. column temperature (46 ± 1 °c) and a constant ﬂow rate (1 ml/min) were sustained throughout the experiment. a sample volume of 20 μl was injected and the corresponding peaks were detected at 254 nm. 2.5.4. determination of cortical acetyl- / butyrylchloinestrases. the procedure used for acetylcholinesterase (ache) was a modiﬁcation of the method of ellman et al. (1961) as described by gorun et al. (1978). the principle of the method is the measurement of the thiocholine produced as acetylthiocholine is hydrolyzed. the color was read immediately at 412 nm. butrylcholinesterase (buche) activity in cortical supernatant was determined using butrylcholinesterase diagnostic kit purchased from biodiagnostic (cairo, egypt) according to the method of knedel and bottger (1967). 2.6. behavioral tests. 2.6.1. open ﬁeld test (oft). the open ﬁeld test was performed according to the method described by bailey and crawley (2009). the of is a square wooden arena (40 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm high) with red walls and white smooth polished ﬂoor that is divided into a grid of equally sized areas by lines drawn on the chamber ﬂoor for visual scoring of activity by the experimenter. the following parameters were recorded during the 5 min observation period: (i) thigmotaxis time (time spent by the animal exploring the periphery of the arena, usually in contact with the walls and corners); (ii) central square frequency: (frequency with which the mice crossed with all four paws into the central square area); (iii) ambulation frequency: number of squares crossed by the animal; (iv) rearing frequency: number of times the animal stood stretched on its hind limbs with or without forelimb support and (v)grooming frequency: number of face scratching, washing with the hind limbs and licking of the forelimbs. 2.6.2. social interaction test (si). test was performed according to the method described by niijimayaoita et al. (2013). the apparatus for the si test was made of a clear polycarbonate (25.7 cm x 30.8 cm x 18.0 cm high). after habituation for 30 min, the mouse to be tested was randomly assigned to an unfamiliar partner (visitor mouse) of the same strain, age and sex. the pair of unfamiliar mice was placed in the apparatus for 10 min and the total amount of time spent in active si, such as sniﬃng, grooming, following and mounting as well as crawling over or under the visitor mouse in direct contact was recorded. 2.6.3. defensive aggression test. test was performed according to the method described by johansson et al. (2000). for the defensive aggression test, the mouse was lifted by its tail and placed in a plexiglas cage (60 × 31 × 41 cm high) and allowed to habituate for 30 s. the reaction of each mouse to four diﬀerent stimuli was then assessed. (i) a wooden rod was slowly moved to approach and touch the mouse′s snout (0: no response or sniﬀs at the rod; 1: intermittently bites or attacks the rod and/or adopts a defensive upright posture; 2: continuously bites/attacks the rod). (ii) startle to an air puﬀ (air blown from a 50-ml syringe) at the back (0: no jumping response; 2: exaggerated response or some movement; 1:. jumping response). (iii) poking with wooden rod at the ﬂanks (0: no response or sniﬃng at the rod; 1: defensive upright posture; 2: defensive upright posture together with biting/attack). (iv) capturing with a gloved hand (0: very easy to capture; 1: easy to capture but some resistance and/or prolonged vocalization; 2: diﬃcult to capture because of escape; 3: diﬃcult to capture because of attacking or biting; 4: very diﬃcult to capture because of continuous violent attacks/bites). the averages of the total scores (maximum total score 10) from each individual stimuli test was used in the statistical calculations. 2.6.4. morris water maze test (mwm). trail test: individual animals were tested in a spatial version of morris water maze test according to the method described by bromleybrits et al. (2011). the maze consists of a large circular pool with a diameter of 150 cm and a depth of 50 cm of water maintained at room temperature. a platform (10 cm diameter) was located in the pool and concealed below the surface of the water (i.e., ∼ 1 cm). the platform was rendered invisible by making the water opaque using powdered milk. the water maze task was carried out in the last week of the experiment. mice received ﬁve consecutive daily training trials in the following 5 days, with each trial exhibiting a cut-oﬀ time of 60 s and a trial interval of approximately 30 s. if the mouse failed to reach the escape platform within the maximally allowed time of 60 s, it was guided with the help of the experimenter and allowed to remain on the platform for 20 s. the time to reach the platform (escape latency in seconds) was measured. memory consolidation test (probe trial): the time spent in the target quadrant indicates the degree of memory consolidation that has taken place after learning. in the probe trial, the mouse was placed into the pool as in the training trial, except that the hidden platform was removed from the pool. the total time spent in target quadrant in a period of 60 s was recorded (bromley-brits et al., 2011). 2.7. histopathological examination. the brain of each mouse was carefully dissected out and ﬁxed in 10% buﬀered neutral formalin. the ﬁxed brain specimens were routinely dehydrated by graded series of alcohol, cleared in xylol and ﬁnally embedded in paraﬃn. paraﬃn blocks were serially sectioned at 4 u m thickness and stained with haematoxylin and eosin stains (h&e) (bancroft and gamble, 2008). the obtained sections were collected on glass slides, and subjected to histopathological examination using the electric light microscope olympus bh2 (tokyo, japan). 2.8. immunohistocemical examination of cd68, casp-3 and th. for recognition of cd68, caspase-(casp)-3 and tyrosine hydroxylase (th) reactive cells, immunohistochemical procedures were carried out on 4 μm paraﬃn sections of brain tissue of control and diﬀerent treated groups using avidin-biotin peroxidase according to the method described by hsu et al. (1981). brieﬂy, paraﬃn sections were deparaﬃnized in toluene, rehydrated in ethanol, and then incubated with h2o2 for blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity. the sections were incubated with a monoclonal antibody for cd68, casp-3 and th (dako corp, ca, usa). the immune reactive cells for each marker were visualized using tetrahydrochloride (dab, sigma-aldrich, mo, usa). the number of apoptotic cells (casp-3 dependent) was determined by counting the number of positive cells in 5 randomly chosen microscopic ﬁelds at 40x objective magniﬁcation, the area for each microscopic ﬁeld is 18.8913sqmm. chromagen 3, 3-diaminobenzidine. the. 2.9. statistical analysis. all values are presented as means ± standard deviation of the means (sd). comparison between groups was carried out using the nonparametric one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey 247. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. fig. 1.

mice treated with tramadol showed no change in acetyl cholinesterase concentration and butyrylcholinestrase activity in cerebral cortex (fig. 8a–b). nicotine produced a signiﬁcant increase in cortical acetylcholinestrase by 51.2 and 35.4% compared to control and tramadol groups, respectively. however, nicotine had no eﬀect on butyrylcholinestrase activity (fig. 8a–b). furthermore, nicotine

either alone or in combination showed a disturbed performance in mwm with diﬀerent extents, with tramadol showing the least disturbed performance (fig. 9a). the escape latency was signiﬁcantly increased in case of nicotine treated mice compared to tramadol and control groups, indicating a poor learning performance, an eﬀect that was accentuated by co-administration of tramadol with nicotine, showing a poorer learning performance (fig. 9a). in the probe trial, the time spent in the target quadrant was signiﬁcantly lowered in tramadol and nicotine as well as tramadol/nicotine

control group showed negative expression of caspase-3 (a). both tramadol and nicotine elevated expression of caspase-3 immunoreactive positive cells as shown by the intense brown staining particularly in nicotine (b and c). furthermore, co-administration of nicotine with tramadol elevated expression of caspase-3 immunoreactive positive cells (d–e). the number of apoptotic cells (caspase-3

tramadol. additionally, the combined administration had more deleterious eﬀect than the sole administrations. the between-group comparisons were made in the same anatomic layers of the cerebral cortex (mostly layers ii to v were the most aﬀected with less severity in layers i and vi). the brain sections of mice given tramadol (fig. 11a/b) showed vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of some pyramidal neurons (fig. 11a/c) with neuronophagia, the necrotic cells appeared darkly stained, structure-less without nuclei while others appeared faintly stained ghost–like. apoptotic cells and few apoptotic

pyramidal neurons appeared irregular darkly stained with pyknotic nuclei and surrounded by halos while others appeared shrunken necrotic and few appeared faintly stained ghost like with widely spread neuronophagia (fig. 11a/f). the cerebral cortex of some animals showed hypercellularity (fig. 11b/a), marked vacuolation of the neuropil with apparent neuronal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis as well as neuronophagia. astrocytic reaction was noticed as swelling, edema and nuclear pyknosis. apoptotic cells and bodies (fig. 11b/b) were observed in all cases but of variable severity. examination of brain tissue of the mice given tramadol and nicotine (fig. 11b/c), revealed focal glial cells proliferation, marked shrinkage, vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of the neurons. some. necrotic neurons appeared as remnants (fig. 11b/d) while others appeared with pyknotic nuclei or appeared ghost-like without any nuclear structure accompanied with many apoptotic cells and bodies. neuronophagia (fig. 11b/e), hyperactivity of astrocytes and vacuolation of neuropil were all noticed. few mice showed perivascular cuﬃng of the congested cerebral vessels (fig. 11b/f). 4. discussion. in the current investigation we provide the ﬁrst evidence, to authors′ knowledge, regarding the divergent behavioral/neurotoxic effects of combining nicotine and tramadol. on one hand, tramadol in association with nicotine improved social interaction while decreasing anxiety and aggression linked to chronic administration of nicotine. however, on the other hand, this combination elicited negative eﬀects regarding learning and memory consolidation. tramadol and nicotine neurotoxic eﬀects were investigated via assessment of diﬀerent markers of oxidative stress, inﬂammation and apoptosis, in addition to histopathological examination of brain tissue. prior to pursuing the neurochemical and neurobehavioral alterations induced by co-administration of tramadol and nicotine, it was imperative to determine whether nicotine had an eﬀect on tramadol concentration in mice brain. noteworthy, in the current investigation, nicotine induced a signiﬁcant increase in tramadol

nicotine might lend a plausible explanation for the heightened mortality seen with the combination. the current ﬁndings can be explained in the light of study of wang et al.(2015) who reported that nicotine altered tramadol metabolism and increased cmax of tramadol and m1 in cerebrospinal ﬂuid in rats; an event that would be attributed to induction of brain cyp450 2d enzyme by nicotine and enhance tramadol metabolism. moreover, the present results are supported with the study of solarino et al. (2010) who reported multidrug poisoning case involving tramadol and nicotine and attributed the fatality to that nicotine enhanced the eﬀect of tramadol, suggesting that this combination may be toxic in large doses. in the present study, a signiﬁcant increase in cortical oxidative/nitrosative stress of mice subjected to tramadol and nicotine alone or in combination, reﬂected by increased tbars and no paralleled by decreased npshs. noteworthy, microglia, the brain resident macrophages presents one source for the increased ros (carniglia et al., 2017). indeed, the present investigation outlines increased microglial immunoreactivity as manifest by enhanced cd68 positive cells in mice receiving either treatment alone or in combination. these results are consistent with several lines of evidence which indicated that repeated administration of tramadol (abdel-zaher et al., 2011) and nicotine (bhagwat et al.,1998; gumustekin et al., 2003; hritcu et al., 2009) increased oxidative stress in the brain. furthermore, da auto-oxidation could aﬀord a second plausible theory explaining oxidative stress accompanied with most of drugs of abuse (cunha-oliveira et al., 2013). da quinones, which are electron-deﬁcient molecules, can readily react with cysteinyl residues of proteins, such as gsh leading to glutathione depletion (miyazaki and asanuma, 2008); events that are supported by ﬁndings from this present report. indeed, many studies reported that nicotine administration induced apoptosis in brain via increase of oxidative stress and moreover, nicotine was found to produce a remarkable loss of neurons in mid brain and cortex of adolescent rodents (ferrea and winterer, 2009; hritcu et al., 2009). the production of reactive nitrogen species (rns) such as the. fig. 8. tramadol alone had no eﬀect on cortical acetyl (a) and butyryl (b) cholinestrases while mice receiving nicotine alone showed increase in cortical acetylcholinestrase. furthermore mice given nicotine with tramadol showed a signiﬁcant increase in both en(6–8) zymes. data are expressed as mean of experiments ± sdm. statistical analyses were carried out by anova followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test. *: signiﬁcant from control, #: signiﬁcant from tramadol at p < 0.05. 253. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. fig. 9. mice given tramadol and nicotine alone or in combination showed a disturbed performance in mwm (a); the time spent in the target quadrant was signiﬁcantly less in groups receiving the aforementioned drugs in probe test (b); tramadol alone showed no change in defensive aggression and social interaction tests (c–d), nicotine treated mice displayed increased aggression score and decreased (si) time (c–d), however mice given tramadol in addition to nicotine showed decrease in aggression and increase in (si) time compared to nicotine per se (c–d). data are (6–8) experiments ± sd. expressed as mean of statistical analyses were carried out by two way anova followed by bonferroni post test for mwm learning curve (a) and one way anova followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test for probe test (b),aggression (c),social interaction (d) *: signiﬁcant from control, #: signiﬁcant from tramadol, @: signiﬁcant from nicotine at p < 0.05. radical nitric oxide (no) and its metabolite peroxynitrite (onoo−) present another form of cellular stress (hastings, 2009). in fact, the current investigation demonstrates increased no by nicotine and/or tramadol subsequent to enhanced nnos/inos content. worthy of note, microglial cells produce not only no but also a variety of proinﬂammatory cytokines (carniglia et al., 2017). certainly, the present study showed a signiﬁcant increase in inos and tnf-α levels in cortices of mice subjected to tramadol and nicotine alone or in combination. worth mentioning, the increase in case of tramadol/nicotine combination was signiﬁcant compared to tramadol or nicotine alone. the induction of these inﬂammatory mediators is mediated by several different pathways, one important pathway is through nf-κb (karin, 2005). in fact, the present ﬁndings display augmented nf-κb, which is considered to be redox sensitive transcription factor (gloire et al., 2006) that could have been activated by the present increase in ros. nf-κb inﬂuences the expression of genes encoding proinﬂammatory cytokines in microglial cells like tnf-α and inos as well (mattson and camandola, 2001). in addition, tnf-α may indirectly increase inos in an nf-κb independent pathway thus adding to the proxidant milieu. (nassar et al.,2015). worth mentioning, the increment in tnf-α observed in this study could lend credence to the observed reduction in body weight seen in the current investigation with the three diﬀerent regimens. certainly, increased serum tnf-α inhibits the uptake of circulating free fatty acids and accelerates lipolysis in adipose tissue (kirana et al., 2011; georgy et al., 2013). the current investigation displays an increased number of casp-3 positive cells in groups receiving either tramadol or nicotine alone or in combination. noteworthy, the observed increment in ros as well as proinﬂammatory cytokines induce apoptotic cascades through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (dong et al., 2009). moreover, the current investigation displays an increment in glu, inos and nnos. indeed glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in several processes involved in drug addiction, including reinforcement, sensitization, habit learning, craving, and relapse (tzschentke and schmidt, 2003). in a feed-forward cycle, glu induced excitotoxicity is caused by a massive inﬂux of extracellular ca2+ resulting from the overactivation of the n-methyl- d-aspartate (nmda) glu receptors which further contributes to stress burden and hence casp-3 activation (zhang and. 254. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. fig. 10. tramadol produced a signiﬁcant decrease in thigmotaxis time (a) paralleled with increase in central square frequency (b) in addition to increase in ambulation (c), rearing (d) and grooming (e) frequencies. nicotine alone induced a signiﬁcant increase in grooming frequency (e) and had no change on other parameters (a–d). mice receiving tramadol with nicotine displayed a signiﬁcant decrease in thigmotaxis time (a) accompanied with increase in central square frequency (b) compared to nicotine alone, in addition to a signiﬁcant increase in grooming frequency (e) compared to tramadol or nicotine. data are expressed as mean of (6–8) experiments ± sd. statistical analyses were carried out by anova followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test. *: signiﬁcant from control, #: signiﬁcant from tramadol, @: signiﬁcant from nicotine at p < 0.05. bhavnani, 2006). consequent to the excitotoxicity exerted by glu, the rise intracellular ca2+can stimulate nnos through interaction with calmodulin resulting in massive increase in no level, which in turn can.− to form toxic onoo- (parathath et al., 2007; dong react with o2 et al., 2009; cunha-oliveira et al., 2013) to further exacerbate the free radical pool in addition to the observed changes seen with inos; thus implicating both isoenzymes in the damage exerted by tramadol and nicotine either alone or in combination. the aforementioned abnormalities and biochemical data were further conﬁrmed by histopathological examination of the brain cortices. the brain sections of mice receiving tramadol showed vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of some pyramidal neurons in addition to few apoptotic bodies. these histopathological changes are consistent with those reported by atici et al. (2004) who found that chronic use of tramadol caused neuron degeneration which may lead to cerebral dysfunction. moreover, consistent with oxidative/nitroactive stress, exaggerated inﬂammation and excitotoxicity reported herein following nicotine administration, the cerebral cortex of such mice showed hypercellularity, marked vacuolation of the neuropil, astrocytic reaction and apoptotic bodies. furthermore, administration of tramadol with. nicotine caused focal glial cells proliferation, hyperactivity of astrocytes, vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of the neurons. these results support our ﬁndings concerning activation of microglial cells by ros induced by tramadol and nicotine which sequentially lead to release of inﬂammatory cytokines/superoxide anion and at last apoptosis. dopaminergic neurons are prone to oxidative stress due to their high rate of oxygen metabolism, low levels of antioxidants, and high iron content (halliwell, 1992). paradoxically, this study showed that administration of tramadol and nicotine either alone or in combination resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in cortical da level, paralleled with the increased expression of th in midbrain region. our results are supported by study of nakamura et al. (2008) which reported, that tramadol increased da level via activation of μ-opioid receptors, expressed in ventral tegmental area (vta) in midbrain region and potentiation of mesolimbic pathway. other studies also reported that nicotine can stimulate mesocorticolimbic system and enhance da release by direct stimulation of nicotinic receptors in vta (koob and le moal, 2008; cachope and cheer, 2014). furthermore, experimental evidence outlies a co-modulatory eﬀect for that nicotine and opioids, where nicotine was found to induce da release through activation of μ-opioid receptors in. 255. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. fig. 11. a: photomicrographs depicting the histological appearance of cerebral cortices (cx) of control mice showing normal histological structure (a). mice given tramadol (20 mg/kg) (b–d) showing; neuronal vacuolar degeneration (arrow), few apoptotic bodies (short arrow) and necrosis with neuronophagia (dashed arrow) (c–d). mice subjected to nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) (e–f) showing; darkly stained neurons with pyknotic nuclei, others shrunken necrotic and few ghost like (arrow) with marked neuronophagia (dashed arrow) (f) (h&e). b: cx of (a–b) mice subjected to nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) showing; hypercellularity (a), apparent neuronal vacuolar degeneration (arrow) and necrosis as well as apoptotic cells and bodies (dashed arrow) (b). cx of mice given combined tramadol and nicotine (c–f) showing; marked shrinkage and necrosis of the neurons (arrow) with remenents of necrotic cells (short arrow) (d) and marked neuronophagia (dashed arrow), neuronoal vacuolar degeneration (e), many apoptotic cells and bodies (arrow head) and perivascular cuﬃng (double-line arrow) of the cerebral vessels (f) (h&e). the vta (tanda and di chiara, 1998; skurtveit et al., 2010). in addition, another study highlighted the existence for a mechanistic overlap between opiates and nicotine within da reward pathway (britt and mcgehee, 2008). consequently, our results may explain one of the. possible mechanisms underlying reward, addiction and dependence regarding tramadol and nicotine via potentiation of mesocortical pathway and increase da levels. however, one might argue against the discrepancy of enhanced. 256. s.m. azmy et al. neurotoxicology 67 (2018) 245–258. casp-3 versus the preservation of da neurons. albeit, evidence suggests that an increment in glu was observed consequent to casp-3 that further contributes to increased addiction (kenny, 2011) and hence increased da content consequent to th expression; events seen in all treatments in the present study. cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain with its extensive cortical projections play a crucial role in cognitive and behavioral functions (giacobini, 2003). in our study, mice subjected to nicotine showed a signiﬁcant increase in ache level, whereas mice receiving tramadol and nicotine showed a signiﬁcant increase in both ache and buche activities; corroborating with the disrupted performance observed in mwm test and memory consolidation. indeed, a study by (hu et al., 2009) revealed increased ache in relation to increase casp-3 expression and apoptosis in brain. accordingly, in the present investigation the surge in ache accompanied with the enhanced expression of casp-3 in nicotine and nicotine/tramadol treated mice lend credence to the involvement of apoptosis in cognitive impairment induced by nicotine or tramadol/ nicotine. on a closer look, ache was not elevated with tramadol alone which would seemingly oppose the changes in mwm seen with the sole tramadol administration. one plausible explanation for this observation might be attributed to the present enhancement of cortical 5 h t and gaba, which have been shown previously to impair memory function (fontana et al., 1995; hosseini-sharifabad et al., 2016). the cortical area is not only involved in reward processing and cognitive functions, but also moderates social behavior, mood as well as anxiety (martin et al., 2009). noteworthy, such disorders are mediated by a plethora of neurotransmitter/amino acids disruptions. in the present study, mice subjected to tramadol showed a signiﬁcant increase in cortical serotonin, ne and gaba levels. moreover, tramadol treated mice showed anxiolytic behavior in oft which was manifested by signiﬁcant decrease in thigmotaxis time paralleled with increase in central square frequency. in addition, tramadol showed a signiﬁcant increase in ambulation, rearing and grooming frequencies. the current ﬁndings are supported by study of gholami et al. (2014) who reported that chronic tramadol re-exposure resulted in marked anxiolytic-like behaviors due to the ability of tramadol to inhibit 5 h t and ne reuptake in brain (faron-gorecka et al., 2004). worthy of note, the role of gaba has long been regarded as central to the regulation of anxiety and this neurotransmitter system is the target for many drugs used for treatment of anxiety disorders (nuss, 2015). nicotine anxiogenic like eﬀects could be mediated by enhancement of the release of some neurotransmitters such as, glu and ne which are known to facilitate stress/anxiety related behavior (balerio et al., 2005). consistent with previous ﬁndings, in the current investigation, nicotine exposed mice showed a signiﬁcant increase in cortical ne and glu levels paralleled with decrease in gaba levels. noteworthy, studies reported that decreased gaba levels are associated with mood and anxiety disorders (kent et al., 2002). these changes in neurotransmitters and glu levels were reﬂected by increased anxiogenic behavior in oft as manifested with increase thigmotaxis time paralleled with decrease central square frequency. in addition, there was a signiﬁcant increase in grooming frequency reﬂecting the increase in da level (kalueﬀ et al., 2016). ht and ne play a crucial role in modulating aggressive behavior. elevated ne or decreased gaba levels may develop aggression (eichelman, 1990). moreover, increased excitatory glutaminergic activity is associated with social anxiety disorders (martin et al., 2009). by the same token, mice receiving nicotine showed aggressive behavior and decrease in social interaction which may be attributed to decrease gaba levels and step up in ne and glu levels. interestingly, mice subjected to tramadol and nicotine showed a signiﬁcant increase in cortical 5 h t and gaba levels at the same time as decreasing in ne level compared to nicotine per se and this was reﬂected in behavior tests as decreased in anxiety and aggressive behavior in addition to improvement in social interaction test compared to mice subjected to nicotine only. however, tramadol alone had no eﬀect on defensive. aggression or social interaction tests. taken all together; ﬁndings from the present study provide compelling evidence for neurotoxic eﬀects associated with co-administration of tramadol and nicotine despite enhanced reward manifested as increased da and th. indeed, neurotoxicity is mediated through increase oxidative/nitrosative stress and enhanced levels of no via induction of nnos consequent to increments in glu and inos downstream from nf-κb, tnf-α leading to neuroinﬂammation and at last apoptosis. correlatively, the neuroinﬂammation and casp-3 activation may contribute to the memory deﬁcits induced by tramadol and nicotine. however, administration of tramadol and nicotine improved social interaction while decreasing anxiety and aggression associated with chronic administration of nicotine. hence, many smokers tend to abuse tramadol as a phenomenal behavior, to reduce aggression and anxiety linked to nicotine while enhancing reward, however, such combination exacerbated neurotoxic eﬀects and elicited negative eﬀects regarding learning and memory. conﬂict of interest. none. \n"
